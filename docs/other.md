This website is the new home of Midnight Commander.

The main project forge has been moved from [Savannah](https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/mc) and later Trac to a new forge hosted by [GitHub](https://github.com/MidnightCommander/mc).

We used to run a self-hosted Trac instance for over a decade to serve as our home page, wiki, source browser, and issue tracker. With the retirement of Trac, most of these items have been moved to GitHub.
