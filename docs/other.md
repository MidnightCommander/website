This website is the new home of Midnight Commander.

The main project forge has been moved from [Savannah](https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/mc) and later Trac to a new forge hosted by [GitHub](https://github.com/MidnightCommander/mc).

We used to run a self-hosted Trac instance for over a decade to serve as our home page, wiki, source browser, and issue tracker. With the retirement of Trac, most of these items have been moved to GitHub.

## Skin editor

A third party has developed an online skin editor for Midnight Commander that can be accessed through a browser without installation:

* <https://github.com/phplego/mc>

## Trac archives

The old server is still available at <https://old.midnight-commander.org> until it is decommissioned. Please let us know if there is any content you would like to secure!

* [Files]({{ extra.organization_url }}/trac-archive)
* [Wiki]({{ extra.organization_url }}/trac-archive/wiki)
