GNU Midnight Commander is a visual file manager released under the GNU General Public License and therefore qualifies as Free Software.

It's a feature-rich, full-screen, text-mode application that allows you to copy, move, and delete files and entire directory trees, search for files, and execute commands in the subshell. Internal viewer, editor and diff viewer are included.

Midnight Commander uses versatile text interface libraries such as [ncurses](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/) or [S-Lang](https://www.jedsoft.org/slang/), which allows it to work on a regular console, inside an X Window terminal, over `ssh` connections, and in all kinds of remote shells.

This site is the new home of Midnight Commander. The main project repository has been moved from [Savannah](https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/mc) to a new Git repository hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/MidnightCommander/mc).
