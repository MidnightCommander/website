Communication, discussion, and decision-making within the Midnight Commander project is primarily done through [mailing list](#mailing-lists) conversations.

Alternatively, we have opened up [GitHub Discussions]({{ config.repo_url }}/discussions) for those who prefer a more forum-like experience.

To report an issue or file a feature request please use our [issue tracker on GitHub]({{ config.repo_url }}/issues).

!!! warning
    Please keep in mind that the project is maintained by volunteers who code and communicate in their spare time for the fun of it. There is no entitlement to commercial-grade support, service level agreements, or any kind of warranties.

    For best results, follow ["The Core Rules of Netiquette"](http://www.albion.com/netiquette/index.html) by Virginia Shea, which has not lost its relevance since 1994. In short, be pleasant and polite... and have fun!
